🚀 Why I Built This

Coordinating meetings across different timezones can be messy.
This tool makes it visual, fast, and frustration-free – especially for teams working across APAC, Europe, and the US.

It also serves as a showcase of what’s possible when AI (GPT-5) and developer skills combine:

AI helped accelerate UI design & optimization

I focused on logic, problem-solving, and fine-tuning usability

Together, it became a polished, useful tool in just a short span of time.
